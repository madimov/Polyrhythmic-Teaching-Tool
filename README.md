# Polyrhythmic-Teaching-Tool

The goal is to create an accurate visual tool for learning polyrhythms. Via real-time visual feedback, the user should be able to learn each component of the polyrhythm, allocate it to a specific limb, and then combine the two components. The aim is to find a visualization that is most intuitive, that allows the fastest learning, and the quickest minimizing of error. While similar tools exist, they rely on auditory cues, and their visuals do not intuitively combine the polyrhythmic components.
